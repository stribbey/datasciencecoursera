### who is taking the first step into the data world through this class

*I work for the State of Oregon, Department of Public Safety Standards & Training

*I am technically the Training Evaluation Coordinator, but perform a variety of tasks and responsibilities within the agency and my particular team

*Our agency has not done much with proficiency related data in the past, but I'm hoping to be able to learn and possibly be able to use data more intentionally and purposefully in relation to our training programs.

*Evaluation and assessment are my long-term goals for learning data
